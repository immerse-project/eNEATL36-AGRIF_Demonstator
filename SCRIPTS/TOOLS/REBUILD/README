The scripts facilitate the use of NEMO REBUILD tool


HOW TO USE 

1 - Change path of the REBUILD_NEMO executable EXE_REBUILD in rebuild_and_clean_immerse.sh

2 - Copy rebuild_and_clean_immerse.sh and rebuild_pergrid.sh in your run directory

3 - To launch the rebuild script :  

sbatch rebuild_and_clean_immerse.sh GRID_NAME_PREFIX

where GRID_NAME_PREFIX is the name of the grid, which is use as prefix for the file names

ex : if your grid name is eNEATL36 over the parent domain and AGRIF over the child domain :

- the NEMO outputs have the form : 
PARENT : eNEATL36_1?_grid*_????????-????????.nc
CHILD  : 1_AGRIF_1?_grid*_????????-????????.nc

- Then, do : 
PARENT : sbatch rebuild_and_clean_immerse.sh eNEATL36
CHILD : sbatch rebuild_and_clean_immerse.sh 1_AGRIF

Nb : you can change the list of the grids you want to rebuild (ex : 1h_gridT, 1d_gridV etc ...) by modifying the list "gridlist" in rebuild_and_clean_immerse.sh
